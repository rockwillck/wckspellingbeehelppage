            <h3>What is Buzz Bee?</h3>
            <p>Buzz Bee is a premium spelling bee study tool, made by regional spelling bee finalists and developers. It brings straight forward, clean material straight from Scripps to your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>Every year, Buzz Bee has a new, updated list of Scripps spelling bee words added to the app. These are the oneBee, twoBee, and threeBee lists (Scripps named them, not us) that increase in difficulty as with their names. Using definitions and pronounciations from Merriam-Webster (the official dictionary of the Scripps national spelling bee), BuzzBee helps you study, prepare, and correct your mistakes.</p>

            <h3>Study View</h3>
            <p>In study view, you study words directly from Merriam-Webster. Choose your list (oneBee, twoBee, or threeBee). Then, choose your difficulty: study, champion, or extreme. Study and Champion are Scripps provided lists, which are required study material. Study is generally used in school spelling bees, while Champion words are for local spelling bees. Extreme, on the other hand, are words that have been used in past regional and national spelling bees. These are NOT Scripps commissioned, but good study material for the higher levels of competition. You can click "Add to daily review" to add the word to your review bucket in the "Daily Review" tab.</p>
